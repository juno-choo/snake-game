## How to Play

The classic rule applies: **Don't bump into the walls or your own tail!**

Your goal is to grow as long as possible by _eating the food_.

## Requirements (What You'll Need)

Getting this game running is _super easy_. You probably have everything you need already!

- **Python 3**: This is the magic that makes it all run. If you don't have it, you can grab it from the [official python.org website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **Tkinter Library**: This is Python's standard tool for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like our game window.
  - **_For Windows & macOS users:_** Good news! Tkinter is included by default with most Python installations. You shouldn't need to do a thing.
  - **_For Linux users:_** You might need to install it separately. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu, run `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`.
