# üêç snake-game (Project for Code in Place 2025)

## How to Play

The classic rule applies: **Don't bump into the walls or your own tail!**

Your goal is to grow as long as possible by _eating the food_.

## Requirements (What You'll Need)

Getting this game running is _super easy_. You probably have everything you need already!

- **Python 3**: This is the magic that makes it all run. If you don't have it, you can grab it from the [official python.org website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### **_Have fun!_**
